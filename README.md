**Project description:**

Our client is asking for a web page for their event agency providing us with a draft which displays the desired layout.


The final version is made with Bulma framework, you can find it [here!](https://g-uillaume.github.io/Main-eventer)

# Team

* Marie      (*Project manager J2*)
* Richard
* Maxime
* Guillaume (*Project manager J1*)

**Main task:**

We divided this project in sections, each one of us has picked one by affinity.

To track our progress we have used [Trello](https://trello.com/b/uDCC5Tby/main-eventer) which helped us to define the different tasks to be done and their completion.

Finally, we have made sure to have a mobile friendly website by making it responsive.
